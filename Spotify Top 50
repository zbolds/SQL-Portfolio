# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the average danceability by artist and track.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(danceability), avg(popularity), avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name, artist_name LIMIT 10

#Second I found which artist released the longest track.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, max(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

#Third I found the top 10 artists based on popularity.
SELECT artist_name, avg(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name LIMIT 10

#Next I found how many artists had more than 1 top song and how many they had if applicable.
SELECT artist_name, count(track_name) as count_songs
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING count_songs > 1
